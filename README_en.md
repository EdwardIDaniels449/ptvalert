# PtvAlert Web Version

## Project Overview

PtvAlert Web is a real-time event reporting and visualization platform based on Google Maps and Firebase. Users can add reports with images and descriptions on the map, and all users can see these reports in real time. Each report is displayed as an emoji marker on the map. Clicking the marker shows details, comments, edit, or delete options. Reports automatically disappear from the map and database 3 hours after creation.

  - Reduced danmaku movement speed for better readability (10-15 seconds to complete one movement)

## Dependencies
- [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview)
- [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)
- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
- No backend server required; all data is synced in real time to Firebase

## Local Development & Deployment

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key**
   - Apply for and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY...` in `index.html`
2. **Configure Firebase**
   - Use your own Firebase project and replace the `firebaseConfig` in both `index.html` and `login.html`
   - Enable Email/Password and Anonymous authentication methods in your Firebase console
   - Detailed steps:
     1. Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
     2. Create a new project or select an existing one
     3. Enable "Email/Password" sign-in method under "Build > Authentication > Sign-in method"
     4. Get your Firebase configuration object from "Settings > Project settings > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration"
     5. Copy the configuration to the `firebaseConfig` variable in both `login.html` and `index.html`
     6. Add your domain to "Authentication > Settings > Authorized domains" (add localhost for local development)
3. **Preview locally**
   - Recommended: use VSCode "Live Server" extension or `npx http-server`
   - Opening `index.html` directly in the browser may limit some features (e.g., image upload, geolocation)

## Notes
- This project is a pure front-end static implementation; all user data is publicly stored in Firebase
- Do not upload sensitive or private information/images
- For production deployment, configure your own domain, API keys, and Firebase security rules
